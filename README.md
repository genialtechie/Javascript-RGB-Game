# Javascript-RGB-Game
A game to polish your RGB skills built with pure Javascript. I built this project to improve my DOM manipulation skills. It is built with HTML, CSS & JS

## Usage
Simply open this link [RGB Game](https://codepen.io/hbo2023/pen/LYEyByW). The game has easy and hard modes, to win, simply guess the right color for the combination of Red, Green & Blue values in the RGB scale. For every correct guess, the color of the screen changes to the chosen color, for every wrong guess, the chosen color is removed from the screen. 

Stars & reviews are very welcome.
